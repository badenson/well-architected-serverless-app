# Architecture Decisions

## Microservices Approach

- Each business capability is implemented as a separate Lambda function
- Functions are independently deployable and scalable
- Communication via API Gateway (synchronous) or EventBridge (asynchronous)

## Event-Driven Design

- SNS topics for pub/sub messaging
- SQS queues for decoupled, reliable processing
- EventBridge for event bus and scheduling

## Security

- IAM roles with least privilege for each Lambda function
- API Gateway with JWT authorizer for authentication
- DynamoDB with fine-grained access control
- Secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager

## Infrastructure as Code

- AWS SAM for Lambda-focused deployments
- Terraform alternative for multi-service provisioning
- Parameterized templates for different environments
